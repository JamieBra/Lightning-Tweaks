# Lightning-Tweaks

This is the source code for the latest release of <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/lightning-tweaks">Lightning Tweaks</a> for Minecraft 1.15.x. I'll be keeping this branch up to date.

The API will likely be changing rapidly during the early development of this branch.

<h3>To-Do</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add check for whether a lightning bolt is spawned from a trident before moving it.</li>
	<li>Add lightning discharge map if JourneyMap is installed.</li>
	<li>Add option to change how many chunks are searched when lightning is spawned.</li>
	<li>Add option to change the color of lightning.</li>
	<li>Add update checker.</li>
	<li>Adjust lightning behavior to model real world lightning. Basically, calculate resistance for different paths.</li>
	<li>Restore vanilla fire spawning around the location of a lightning strike.</li>
	<li>Write documentation.</li>
</ul>
