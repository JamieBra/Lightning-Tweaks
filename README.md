# Lightning-Tweaks

This is just the source code for the latest release of <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/lightning-tweaks">Lightning Tweaks 2</a>. I'll be keeping this up to date.

The API will likely be changing rapidly during the early development of this branch.

<h3>To-Do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add code documentation.</li>
  <li>Add Forge auto-updater. It just notifies you in game when an update to the mod is available.</li>
  <li>Add lightning discharge map if JourneyMap is installed.</li>
  <li>Add log messages for all the fancy magic this mod does.</li>
  <li>Add mod description.</li>
  <li>Add option to change how many chunks are searched when a lightning bolt is spawned.</li>
  <li>Add option to stop fire from spawning altogether.</li>
  <li>Apply this mod's logic to the lightning from Local Weather, Storms & Tornadoes. This may already be the case, but it's hard to tell; the mod author doesn't have a readily available way to summon lightning.</li>
  <li>Make lightning sometimes strike living entities when they are real high up, wearing metal armor, or holding something metal and add config options to control this.</li>
  <li>Make lightning strike metallic blocks more often than non-metallic blocks and add config options to control this.</li>
  <li>Stop fire from spawning at original lightning strike position.</li>
  <li>Stop fire from spawning upon striking a metal object.</li>
</ul>
